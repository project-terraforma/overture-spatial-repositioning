# Overture Spatial Repositioning

## Team
Jack Dao  
Ethan Lee  

## Project Description
This project prototypes a spatial repositioning system for Overture Places to improve location and positional accuracy. We will define what a correct place pin location should be, build a ground truth dataset (about 500 to 1,000 places) to measure current spatial offset, and explore modeling approaches that can reposition a place to a better location using a provided sample of about 5,000 Overture places.

## Deliverables
1. A working definition of where the pin location should be
2. A report estimating positional offset in the provided data
3. A prototype repositioning approach with recommendations for future work
